# Nice Rocks
#### *An antiviral social sharing platform*
This project is in its second iteration, being rebuilt in React Native. The code for the first iteration is [here](https://github.com/Samtfm/nice-rocks-web)


## What's the point?
**Primary use case:** You want to recommend a book or a movie to a close friend.
- Direct messaging or texting is unnecessarily immediate and intrusive.
- Passively sharing on social media doesn't guarantee that the message will be received.  

**How is Nice Rocks different:**
 - Asynchronous sharing lets the receiver explore recommended content
 - Having a dedicated archive stops recommendations from being buried in long timelines or chat threads.
 - 1-to-1 sharing encourages more personal notes and recommendations. There is no way to "share with all your friends"
